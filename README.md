App that acts as a phone dialer.
Contains 3 extra buttons that act as "speed-dials". To use them, long press on one of them, add a number to it 
and then click the button again to associate a name with the phone number. Press it again to make call.

Ways to better the app:
-> Delete name and number from speed dial buttons
